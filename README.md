# TidesOfMadness

Tides of Madness is a C++ game project currently in development. The project focuses on building core gameplay systems, character progression, and a clean, maintainable codebase. It serves as both a learning project and a foundation for a larger game concept.

Project Overview

Tides of Madness is being developed to strengthen skills in C++ and game development while applying object-oriented programming principles. The goal is to design systems that are modular, readable, and scalable as the project grows. Current development emphasizes structure and architecture before expanding heavily into gameplay content.

Technologies Used

Language: C++
IDE: Visual Studio
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Build Configuration: Win32 and x64 (Debug and Release)

Project Structure

Character-related classes are organized through a centralized header file called PlayCharacter.h. This approach simplifies include management and reduces dependency issues across the project. Game logic is separated into logical components to keep systems easy to understand and extend.

Current and Planned Features

Current features include a base character class structure, an early leveling system foundation, and refactored header organization for improved maintainability.

Planned features include combat mechanics, enemy AI, an inventory and equipment system, save and load functionality, and a more complete gameplay loop.

Getting Started

Clone the repository from GitHub, open the solution file in Visual Studio, build the project in Debug or Release mode, and run the game directly from the IDE.

What I Am Learning

This project has helped me improve my understanding of C++ file organization, header and source dependencies, object-oriented design, and basic game architecture. I am also gaining experience using Git commits to track meaningful development changes and refactors.

Notes

This project is actively under development. Refactors and structural changes are expected as systems evolve and new features are added.
